Firewall Rule Definitions
=========================

.. include:: includes/all.rst

Firewall configuration in ``debops.ferm`` is done through a flexible
definition of rules. There are a number of variables which are used to
reference a set of default rules and can be extended by user defined
rules. Here a description of the involved configurations should be given
so that everyone can customize the ruleset according to individual
requirements.

.. _default_rules:

Default rules
-------------

By default ``debops.ferm`` configures a number of rules as soon as a
host is part of the ``[debops_all_hosts]`` Ansible host group. The rules
created by default are defined in :file:`defaults/main.yml` and activated by
being listed in :envvar:`ferm__default_rules`. They consist of basic rules for
setting the :command:`iptables` default policies, restricting extensive connection
attempts, logging and more.

In case a firewall is not required or preferred this behaviour can be
disabled by setting :envvar:`ferm__enabled` to ``False`` in the inventory.


.. _custom_rules:

Custom rules
------------

A custom rule can be enabled by adding a rule definition to one of the
predefined rule lists (:envvar:`ferm__rules`, :envvar:`ferm__group_rules`,
:envvar:`ferm__host_rules` or :envvar:`ferm__dependent_rules`) in the Ansible
inventory. Each rule has to be defined as a YAML dict using some of
the following keys:

``type``
  Type of the rule template used for creating the corresponding ferm
  configuration, required. See `Rule templates`_ for a description of
  the available rule templates.

``chain``
  Optional. :command:`iptables` chain to which the rule is added or from which it
  is removed. Defaults to ``INPUT``.

``comment``
  Optional. Comment which should be added to the generated rule configuration.

``domain``
  Optional. :command:`iptables` domain used for the firewall rule. Possible values:
  :command:`ip`, ``ip6``. Defaults to :envvar:`ferm__domains`.

``table``
  Optional. :command:`iptables` table to which the rule is added or from which it
  is removed. Defaults to ``filter``.

``filename``
  Optional. Set custom filename for ferm rule definition instead of generated
  one.

``name``
  Optional. Set rule name in ferm configuration file when ``item.filename`` is
  not set and other places where a custom rule name might be useful.

``by_role``
  Optional. Name of the Ansible role in the format ``ROLE_OWNER.ROLE_NAME``
  which is responsable for the rule.
  The sanitized name will be included in the autogenerated filename.

``role``
  Deprecated. Use ``by_role`` instead.

``role_weight``
  Optional. This allows to set the same ``item.weight`` for all rules of a
  particular Ansible role.

``rule_state``
  Optional. Specify if rule is to be added or removed. Possible values:
  ``present`` or ``absent``. Defaults to ``present``.

``delete``
  This option is deprecated, see `discussion <https://github.com/debops/ansible-apt_preferences/issues/12>`_.
  Use ``rule_state`` instead.
  Delete rule from :program:`ferm` configuration. Possible values ``True``
  or ``False``. Defaults to ``False``.

``weight``
  Optional. Helps with file sorting in rule directory.

``weight_class``
  Optional. Helps to manage order of firewall rules. The ``item.weight_class``
  will be checked in the :envvar:`ferm__weight_map` dictionary. If a corresponding
  entry is found, its weight will be used for that rule, if not, the
  ``item.weight`` specified in the rule will be used instead.

Depending on the chosen type, many additional variables are supported.
Please check the individual template description below.


.. _rule_templates:

Rule templates
--------------

There exist a number of predefined rule templates for generating firewall
rules through ferm. Each rule definition is referencing the used template
through its ``item.type`` key. The templates are located in the
:file:`templates/etc/ferm/ferm.d/` directory.

Following a list of the available rule templates which can be used to
create custom rules.

  Optional. Match all source addresses by default. Possible values: ``True``
  or ``False``. Defaults to ``True``. If this option is set to ``False`` and
  ``item.target`` is set to ``REJECT`` all traffic is blocked by default.
  As soon as ``item.saddr`` is not empty, this configuration doesn't matter
  anymore.

`iptables recent`_ extension. The following template-specific YAML keys are
supported:

``dport``
  Optional. List of destination ports to which the rule is applied.

``include``
  Optional. Custom ferm configuration file to include. See
  `ferm include`_ for more details.

  or ``False``. Defaults to ``False``.

``protocol``
  Optional. Network protocol to which the rule is applied.

  Optional. Must be used in combination with ``item.recent_update``. Match
  if address is in the list and at least the given number of packets were
  received so far.

  if address is in the list and was last seen within the given number of
  seconds.

``recent_set_name``
  Optional. Add the source address of a matching packet to the given list. This
  must correspond with ``item.recent_name`` of a second rule which would
  potentially act on the packet, e. g. reject it.

  Possible values: ``ACCEPT``, ``DROP``, ``REJECT``, ``RETURN``, ``NOP`` or
  a custom target. Defaults to ``NOP``.

  details.

When using the `recent_template`_ template make sure to always define two
rules:

* One for matching the packet against the address list using the
  ``item.recent_update`` feature. If this filter matches you likely want
  to set the ``item.recent_target`` to ``DROP`` or ``REJECT``.

* To clear the source address from the list again in case the connection
  restrictions are not met, add a second role using ``item.recent_remove``.

This template is used in the default role :envvar:`ferm__rules_filter_recent_badguys`
which will block IP addresses which are doing excessive connection attempts.

.. _iptables recent: http://ipset.netfilter.org/iptables-extensions.man.html#lbBW


.. _reject_template:

reject
^^^^^^

Template to reject all traffic. It can be added for example as a final rule
in a custom chain.


.. _legacy_rules:

Legacy rules
------------

Legacy rules are the (old) deprecated way to configure firewall rules
using a simpler less flexible syntax than described above. As support
for these is likely going to be removed in the future, they shouldn't be
used anymore.

Support for legacy rules is still enabled by default. However, they are
stored in a separate :command:`iptables` INPUT chain called
``debops-legacy-input-rules``. In case you haven't defined any legacy
rules and none of the DebOps roles you are using are still depending
on it, disable support completely by setting :envvar:`ferm__include_legacy`
to ``False`` which will avoid the additional chain from being created.

If you're not sure if you still have legacy rules defined, look for
variable names with only on '_' after the :program:`ferm` prefix (e. g.
:envvar:`ferm_input_list` and :envvar:`ferm_input_dependent_list`).
